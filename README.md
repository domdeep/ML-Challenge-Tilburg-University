# Machine Learning-Challenge-Tilburg University

This repository contains all the final files from my submission for the Machine Learning (880665-M-6) course at Tilburg University, completed in May 2024. It includes Jupyter notebooks and a report discussing the methodologies and results. This project received the **maximum grade**.

## Project Overview

This was a group project where we trained and tuned several machine learning algorithms for a prediction task. The goal was to predict the **self-reported well-being score** measured during gameplay designed to reduce stress and improve mental health.

## Algorithms Used:
- **Lasso Regression**
- **XGBoost**
- **DecisionTreeRegressor**
- **RandomForestRegressor**

After significant feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning, RandomForestRegressor emerged as the best-performing model.

## Achievements:
- Achieved **7th place** in a competition with **45 teams**.
- Our final model achieved excellent performance metrics and helped us secure a notable leaderboard position.
- Group Name: **Bladee**
- Competition Site: Hosted on [Codalab competition platform](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/19116?secret_key=9e2695a9-5327-459d-99a1-9b765cd6750b#results)


## Project Structure
- **Code**: The repository contains Python code files in Jupyter format.
- **Report**: The report thoroughly discusses data preprocessing, feature engineering, learning algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, and model performance.
